---------------------Adiabatic Flame Temperature Calculator----------------------

Input ***************************************************************************

Chemical reactions should be split in reactants and compounds, and placed in
their respective text box. For example, the reaction

					        3N2H4 -> 2NH3 + 2N2 + 3H2

Will be typed as

				Reactants:			3N2H4
				Products:		2NH3 2N2 3H2

Note that + signs are not necessary.

In case that recombination effects need to be considered, select the checkbox
and the desired recombination reaction from the list.
Then, input the pressure and select the units.

Output **************************************************************************

Select the desired output temperature, and the type of log.

Simple will return the obtained temperature, and is available for both
recombining and non-recombining input reactions.

Full will show the obtained temperature, along with the recombination molar
fractions (a, b, c). Note that the fractions will fit the compound order of the
recombination reaction, NOT the order of the input reaction. For example:

		Output follows this:	aNH3 <=> bN2 cH2
		NOT this:				3N2H4 -> aNH3 bH2 cN2

However, there is no restriction on the input order, so long as the recombination
reaction is fully contained in the products.
